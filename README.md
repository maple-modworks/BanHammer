This mod has 2 items:
The Ban Hammer
which upon hitting a player with it, will ban them from the server for a specified amount of time, or permanently

To set the ban reason and ban length, right click the item. This is the screen you will get

Hey! Herr Katze! Put the image here!

The other item is the Kick Stick

As with the Ban Hammer, right click to set the kick reason.

 

Both items require level 3 op and will break upon being used outside of Creative mode to prevent abuse of stolen banhammer items.
